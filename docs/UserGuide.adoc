By: `CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-3`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Piconso is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for editing images*. More importantly, Piconso is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Piconso can edit your images faster than Photoshop. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `piconso.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Piconso.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* Flags such as `/a` are compulsory flags that need to be included when using that command
** e.g `g ul ls /a`

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`: viewing list of all commands

// tag::dir[]

Format: `select [INDEX 1-10]`: selects an image for image-editing

Format: `select -all`: adds all images in current directory from working set [Coming in v2.0]

Examples:

* `select 1` +
* `select -all` [Coming in v2.0]

=== Retrieving the next batch of images: `next`

Format: `next`: Retrieves the next 10 images for editing

=== Retrieving the previous batch of images: `prev`

Format: `prev`: Retrieves the previous 10 images for editing
// end::dir[]
// tag::convert[]

=== Applying a transformation to an image : `apply`
You can use the apply command with the given format

Format1: `apply [operation] [arg1] [arg2] ...`: apply the specified transformation to the selected image

[NOTE]
you can also apply your own customized transformation, with the format `apply @Operation`, `@` is necessary

Available transformations

* `blur`: you can performs gaussian blur on the currently opened image, with the argument specified with radius and sigama

** Format: `apply blur [RadiusxSigama]`
** Limit: the value for radius should in between [0 - 99], for sigama should in between [0 - 99]
** Example: `apply blur 0x8`

* `colorspace`: you can change the color space of the current image

** Format: `apply colorspace [color space]`
** Limit: only the provided color spaces is available, can be either up/low case
** Example: `apply colorspace GRAY`

[NOTE]
for some of the color spaces, the image effect may not change after changing the color space

* `contrast`: you can contrast of the image with the default setting.

** Format: `apply contrast`
** Example: `apply contrast`

[NOTE]
the default contrast just hences the effect of the image, the result may not be so obvious,
use sigmodial-contrast if want to make the effect more impressive.

* `motion-blur`: you can perform the motion blur to the image

** Format: `apply motion-blur [RadiusxSigama+Angle]`
** Limit: the value of radius should be between [0-29] the value of sigma should be between [0-19] the value of angle should between [0-99]
** Example: `apply motion-blur 0x8+45`

* `noise`: you can increase the noise of the image

** Format: `apply noise [Radius]`
** Limit: the value of radius should be between [0-29]

* `resize`: you can resize the image to the specified percentage of the original one

** Format: `convert resize [percentage]`
** Limit: the value for the percentage should in between [1% - 300%]
** Example: `convert resize 50%`

[NOTE]
as all the images will be resize to the canvas when displaying, the resize command may reduce a "same" image
on the canvas

* `rotate`: you can rotate an image. DIRECTION [left, right]

** Format: `convert rotate [vlaue]`
** Limit: the value should between -999 to 999
** Example: `convert rotate 90`

** Example: `convert sigmoidal-contrast 10x10%`

Format2: `apply raw [arg1] [arg2]`: pass the arguments entered directly to ImageMagick

[WARNING]
this format is for whom knows how to use ImageMagick, the effect for the arguments cannot be ensured.

// end::convert[]
// tag::create[]

=== Customizing transformation for imageProcessing : `create`

Format: `create [Name_Of_operation] [op1|arg1|arg2|...] [op2|arg1|arg2|...]`: create a customized transformation basing on the default transformations specified

Example:

* `create blurAndRotate blur|0x8 rotate|90`
To use the newly created command, add an `@` before the command used:
`apply @blurAndRotate`

[NOTE]
for the command created, you should add a @ before the command when running the customised command, ie convert @blurR

// end::create[]
// tag::save[]

=== Saving images : `save`

====
The image will be saved in the same directory as the original image. With no image name specified, it will save to the currently opened image.

the format can also be all up cases.
====
// end::save[]
// tag::undoredo[]

=== Undoing a transformation : `undo`

Format: `undo`: Step back to the previous image state (in current layer)

[NOTE]
====
Commands that can be undone: those commands that modify the image's transformation (anything done with `convert`).
====

Example:

=== Redoing a transformation : `redo`

Format: `redo`: Step forward to the previously undone transformation

Example:

* `convert blur 0x8` +
`convert contrast` +
`undo` (undoes the `convert contrast` command, image will be at `blur 0x8` state) +
`redo` (reapplies the `convert contrast` command) +

=== Redoing all transformations : `redo-all`

Format: `redo-all`: Redoes all undone transformations

Example:

* `convert blur 0x8` +
`convert contrast` +
`convert rotate 90` +
`undo-all` (undoes all 3 `convert` commands, image will be at original state) +
`redo-all` (reapplies all 3 `convert` commands) +

Turns on/off the auto-resize for the canvas.
[NOTE]
====
New canvases default to having auto-resize off.
====


Examples:
