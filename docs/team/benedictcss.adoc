== PROJECT: Piconso

---

== Overview

This portfolio seeks to document my contributions to our teamâ€™s project, Piconso. Piconso is an CLI
(Command Line Interface) Image Editor designed and developed for quick and efficient image-editing on your Desktop. With
Piconso, all traditional image-editing features can be performed solely through text commands, removing the hassle of
working with a mouse. Our project team consists of:

* Jeffry Lum -- Project Advisor.
* Ivan Ho -- Team Lead. Responsible for UI component.
* Benedict Chua -- Developer. Responsible for Data management.
* Ong Kai Le -- Developer. Responsible for Development Operations and Threading.
* Zhang Tianyang -- Developer. Responsible for UI component as well.

Below is a list of main features of our application:

* Several traditional image-editing features such as rotate, blur etc.
* Capability to define own custom transformation set.
* Ability to access all your images in your local drive.
* Direct access to images on Google Photos (download and upload).
