== PROJECT: Piconso

---

== Overview

This portfolio seeks to document my contributions to our teamâ€™s project, Piconso. Piconso is an CLI
(Command Line Interface) Image Editor designed and developed for quick and efficient image-editing on your Desktop.
All traditional image-editing features can be performed solely through text commands, removing the hassle of
working with a mouse. Piconso does not only benefit the power users but also serves as a learning platform for new users
with its simple command line tools.

Below is a list of main features of our application:

* Several traditional image-editing features such as rotate, blur etc.
* Capability to define own custom transformation set.
* A wide range of edit-text commands that remove the need for a mouse.
* Direct access to images on Google Photos (download and upload).


== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section summarises the implementations and contributions I've made for this project._

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to cd into different directories.
** What it does: allows the user to traverse between folders in their home system.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows user to access images stored in different folders in their drive.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the model of the product as it now stores the current directory. The implementation was quite challenging as it required changes to the UserPrefs.
* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to select images to display on GUI.
** What it does: allows the user to select the images from the current batch of images.
** Justification: This feature is essential to the product because a user would have to select an image for image-editing.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It requires in depth analysis of design alternative to ensure maximum efficiency in retrieving images.
* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to traverse through images with next/previous command.
** What it does: allows the user to move through the list of images in the current directory.
** Justification: This feature is essential to the product because a user would need to have access to all the images in the current directory for image-editing.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and implemented together with the select feature.
* *Minor enhancement*: added the tab function to auto-complete directory name in current folder and iterate through the list of directories with the given user input.
** Justification: This feature improves users' usability as users are no longer required to enter the full name to access the folders.
