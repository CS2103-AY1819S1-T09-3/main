== Overview

Piconso - The Piconso is a command line image processing tool, supported by ImageMagick, and is built to handle all the image processing in a light and efficient way.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major morphing*: added *the ability to apply the transformation to image, customised transformation*
** What it does: use convert command to apply the transformation, use the create command to create a new transformation.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can apply the transformation he wants, customise and combine multiple transformations to save time.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, touching the external package and excutbale files.
** Credits: _{the processing is done by ImageMagic by calling the executable file in the processbuilder}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a save command that allows the user to save the transformation wanted.
