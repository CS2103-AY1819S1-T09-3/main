== PROJECT: Piconso

---

== Overview

This portfolio seeks to document my contributions to our teamâ€™s project, Piconso. Piconso is an CLI (Command Line Interface) Image Editor designed and developed for quick and efficient image-editing on your Desktop. With Piconso, all traditional image-editing features can be performed solely through text commands, removing the hassle of working with a mouse. Below is a list of main features of the application:

* Several traditional image-editing features such as crop, blur etc.
* Capability to define own custom transformation set.
* Mass editing several images at once
* Direct access to images on Google Photos (download and upload).
