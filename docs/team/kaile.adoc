== PROJECT: Piconso

---

== Overview

Piconso is an CLI (Command Line Interface) Image Editor designed and developed for quick and efficient image-editing. Many image-editors are complex and difficult to pick up, having a steep learning curve and sometimes even a steep price!

Unlike them, Piconso offers the same features, in a much more simplified manner. With Piconso, all traditional image-editing features can be performed solely through text commands, removing the hassle of working with a mouse. The interface can be used by photographers, designers, developers and more, and is very easy to pick up.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *connectivity to Google Photos*
** What it does: Allows the user to login to Google Photos, and view, upload and download images on/to Google Photos.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides a user cloud connectivity to Google Photos, thus the user can immediately retrieve and work on a batch of images from the cloud, and upload his completed work there as well for easy storage and sharing.
** Highlights: This enhancement uses memoization ensure undo/redo commands are almost instant. Since transformations to images take significant time (especially large images) and that users typically want to quickly inspect the before and after of their transformation, it is necessary  for undo and redo to be fast. As such, after each transformation, the resulting transformed image is cached into a temporary folder. Undo and redo operations will shift a pointer leftwards or rightwards and read the selected image, instead of reapplying or reversing a transformation process which is time consuming.
** Credit: Google Photos Java Client API and Google OAuth API have been used throughout Google related commands.The feature that allows login to Google Photos was also based upon the https://github.com/google/java-photoslibrary/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/google/photos/library/sample/demos/AlbumDemo.java [example found here]
* *Minor enhancement*: Added a ls command that allows the user to list the files in their current directory. Additionally, also created and linked the UIs for FilmReel (shows images in current directory batch) and HistoryList (shows history of transformations performed on image)
